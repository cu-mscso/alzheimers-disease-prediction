    "# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction & Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the brain, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and eventually an inability to carry out even the simplest tasks. It’s the most common cause of dementia among older adults ([National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/alzheimers-disease-fact-sheet)).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [Alzheimer's Association](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia), as of 2023, an estimated 6.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease. This number is expected to increase to 13.8 million by 2060. Globally, it is estimated that over 55 million people worldwide have dementia, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common form. As of 2025, Alzheimer's disease affects a significant portion of the population both in the United States and globally. The global number of people with dementia is expected to **reach 139 million by 2050**, with much of this increase occurring in developing countries ([Alzheimer's Disease International](https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "These statistics highlight the growing impact of Alzheimer's disease on individuals, families, and healthcare systems worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will focus on analyzing Alzheimer's disease using publicly available data to:\n",
    "- Analyze the factors associated with the disease and perform statistical data analysis\n",
    "- Use Supervised Machine Learning techniques to predict the risk of disease given patient health information\n",
    "- TODO: Add ML Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal and motivation behind this project is to closely understand health information factors that could be contributing to the early onset of Alzheimer's disease. The predictive analysis will be helpful to patients who are on the cusp of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes & Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brief understanding of how various factors affect the diagnoses of Alzheimer's\n",
    "- How Supervised Machine Learning can be applied to these types of problems?\n",
    "- Given certain health factors for a patient, how well can ML techniques be used to predict early onset of Alzheimer's\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project will be using publicly available data from Kaggle for [Alzheimer's Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset)\n",
    "- Per datasource, this data was generated synthetically and released on Kaggle for educational purposes.\n",
    "- The dataset includes major health factors and diagnosis for each patient, which makes it ideal for Supervised Machine Learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains 35 columns and 2149 rows\n",
    "- Contains both categorical and continuous variables\n",

    "The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed above included the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning:**\n",
    "   - Dropped irrelevant columns (`PatientID` and `DoctorInCharge`) for simplified analysis.\n",
    "   - Checked for missing values (`Null`/`NaN`) and confirmed there were none.\n",
    "   - Verified data types of all columns to ensure consistency.\n",
    "   - Checked for duplicate rows and confirmed there were none in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Target Variable Inspection:**\n",
    "   - Analyzed the `Diagnosis` column, which is the target variable for identifying Alzheimer's disease.\n",
    "   - Ensured the target variable's class distribution was imbalanced, with 1389 negative cases (0) and 760 positive cases (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Visualizations:**\n",
    "   - Generated a correlation matrix and visualized it using a heatmap to understand relationships between features.\n",
    "   - Created scatter plots for pairwise feature correlations to identify patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Distributions:**\n",
    "   - Visualized the distributions of numerical features using histograms to observe their spread and identify potential outliers.\n",
    "   - Examined the distributions of categorical features using count plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis provided vital insights into our dataset's structure, distribution, and relationships, laying the groundwork for feature engineering and predictive modeling. The identified class imbalance in the target variable will require attention during modeling."
